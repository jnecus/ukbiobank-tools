UK Biobank 
----------

UK Biobank is a national and international health resource with unparalleled research opportunities, open to all bona fide health researchers. UK Biobank aims to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of serious and life-threatening illnesses â€“ including cancer, heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, eye disorders, depression and forms of dementia. It is following the health and well-being of 500,000 volunteer participants and provides health information, which does not identify them, to approved researchers in the UK and overseas, from academia and industry. 

See https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/ for further information.


Why use UKBiobank-tools?
------------------------

The UK Biobank contains large amounts of data spanning various formats making it difficult and time consuming to pose specific questions.

UKBiobank-tools enables the user to efficiently filter large ukbiobank metadata according to specific illnesses, medications and variables of interest.


For example, data releases may generate csv files containing many thousands of rows and columns. It may be the case that a researcher is only interested in examining the relationship between a small number of variables, or subset of subjects. UKBiobank-tools may be used to :any:`filter by specific variables <select_variables_label>`


See :ref:`installing` or :ref:`examples` to get started.
